To tackle the case study, I used Power BI to explore and visualize the dataset, focusing on identifying the drivers of decreased NPS performance. I began by analyzing key variables such as Agent Helpful, Agent Ease, Agent Care, and Process Ease to understand their impact on NPS scores. I segmented the data by Tenure Bucket, Call Type, and Team to pinpoint specific areas with low NPS scores and identify trends across different segments. Through this analysis, I found that lower NPS scores were often linked to lower ratings in Agent Helpful and Agent Care, particularly among newer agents with less tenure. Additionally, certain teams and call types were consistently underperforming, highlighting areas for targeted improvements. These insights led to recommendations for enhancing agent training, especially for those with less experience, and streamlining processes to improve issue resolution and customer experience, ultimately aimed at boosting NPS scores.

1. Potential Drivers of Decreased NPS
 The Factors contributing to lower Net Promoter Scores (NPS) include
•	Teams such as Team QUEENTEVIA and Team DONELLA have particularly low NPS, especially for certain call types (e.g., COMMUNICATION, CLAIMS, and PCP CHANGE).
•	A common feature of low NPS drivers is a corresponding drop in Agent Helpful, Agent Care, and Process Ease ratings. These teams struggle with issues like lack of agent helpfulness and ease of interaction.
•	Issue Resolution also plays a significant role, with incomplete resolutions or low resolution rates contributing to dissatisfaction.

3. Supporting Data
The data shows correlations between lower NPS and key performance metrics such as:
•	Agent Helpfulness: Teams with low NPS typically have lower scores for this metric, such as Team QUEENTEVIA (avg help score of 2-3).
•	Process Ease and Agent Care: Teams like Team DONELLA with an avg NPS of 1 have much lower ease and care ratings compared to high-performing teams (e.g., Team ALI with avg NPS of 10).
•	Call Types: Specific call types such as PCP CHANGE and CLAIMS exhibit consistently lower NPS across teams.

3. Recommendations for Improvement
To improve NPS and overall customer satisfaction:
•	Training and Support: Provide targeted training for agents in low-performing teams (e.g., Team QUEENTEVIA and Team DONELLA) to improve their knowledge and ability to resolve issues. Focus on improving helpfulness and care scores.
•	Process Efficiency: Streamline processes for call types like PCP CHANGE and CLAIMS that are associated with lower satisfaction. Simplifying these processes may improve customer experience.
